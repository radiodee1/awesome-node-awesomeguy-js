                <h1>THE STORY:</h1> 
                    <p>In the future, evil robot aligators take over the planet. AWESOMEGUY, the hero, 
                     must find his way around the world, transporting to different places, collecting 
                     points and stopping the alien aligators. Look out for platforms, 
                     pyramids, mazes, castles, and flying steaks. You are AWESOMEGUY. Run away 
                     from the aligators. Jump on them to kill them. Get the crystal to go to the 
                     next level. The key is for the crystal and the rings and gold bricks are worth points. There is also a life or two
                     out there and they are gold too. Have fun.</p>
                     <p> 'Z' is the jump button. The arrow keys move you around. You have to get the key. Only then
                     will the crystal transport you to the next level.</p>

                <!-- p> This game works well on Google Chrome from the 2017.03.01 time period (version 49.0.2623.75). Firefox works on the
                    small screen only, the big screen lagging behind a second or two. If you
                    are attached to Firefox disable the big screen and play on the small screen.</p -->
                <p> This game was originally designed for the Nintendo DS handheld gaming system as a homebrew project. 
                    The game had ten scrolling levels and used five buttons.</p>
                <!-- p> Almost immediately the game was ported to the Android phone. The
                    first port for the Android phone was also used as an independent study
                    for the Computer Science department. Later it
                    was also revised several times. That version of the game had 
                    all the previous levels and also an eleventh level that sported some 3d opengl objects.</p>
                <p> The version you are looking at was implemented entirely in html and javascript. 
                    It has ten levels. The opengl objects from the Android version were omitted. 
                    Also this version does not save your scores in any way.</p>
                <p> Source code for the project can be found on github 
                    <a href="https://github.com/radiodee1/awesome-nb-awesomeguy-js">here.</a></p>
                <p> Source code for other projects I have worked on can be found on github here: 
                    <a href="https://github.com/radiodee1">https://github.com/radiodee1</a>. I also have a sourceforge 
                    account which I seldom use. As I noted above, there is an Android version of this game, and it can be found 
                    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.davidliebman.android.awesomeguy">here</a>.</p>
                <p> I have a blog about these little projects, and it can be found
